## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance are significant because their p-values indicate that changes in the independent variable's value are related to changes in the dependent variable and we can reject the null hypothesis.

- The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero because our correlation coefficient is .8455 and the higher the correlation is between variables, the more that we can explain/predict the value of the other.

- The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero because our R-Squared value is 0.7149 which means that roughly 71% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model
